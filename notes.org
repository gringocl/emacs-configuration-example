* To Dos
- [x] Add org-capture to add to this notes file
- [x] embark in the minibuffer, rather than in a new frame
- [x] windmove left to treemacs
- [x] vterm project root aware
- [ ] Review leader commands in doom setup, i.e. window, buffer, file commands and copy over
- [ ] Stick the end of the buffer to the bottom of the window

** TODO Large diff slows down buffer - look in doom
* Ideas
** If I mostly use 1 window and occasionally only use 2. `other-window` is all that I should need. I can just not worry about windmove-<direction>

* To Dos
- [x] Add org-capture to add to this notes file
- [x] embark in the minibuffer, rather than in a new frame
- [x] windmove left to treemacs
- [x] vterm project root aware
- [ ] Review leader commands in doom setup, i.e. window, buffer, file commands and copy over
- [ ] Stick the end of the buffer to the bottom of the window
- [ ] evil-multiedit
- [ ] flyspell in minibuffer
- [ ] evil-complete-next-line
** TODO Indenting issues in markdown-mode

[[file:~/wsgr/neuron/work-logs/miles-starkenburg.md::-]]
** TODO Large diff slows down buffer - look in doom
** TODO I want splits to open new vterm sessions in the same directory
* Ideas
** If I mostly use 1 window and occasionally only use 2. `other-window` is all that I should need. I can just not worry about windmove-<direction>
